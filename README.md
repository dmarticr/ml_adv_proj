Predicting the approval or rejection of legislative bills in legislative chambers such as Congress and the Senate holds great significance for policymakers and decision-makers. This project provides an approach to analyzing the written content of bills through the task of classifying bill summaries as approved or not. The complexity of this task necessitates the utilization of advanced techniques, and our research demonstrates that a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model outperforms other classification methods, achieving a precision level of 75%. Additionally, we present valuable insights into the distinct topics and entities that differentiate passed bills from those that failed to pass. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques, this project offers a powerful tool for policymakers to better understand the factors influencing bill approval and enhance decision-making processes.
