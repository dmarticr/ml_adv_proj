(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to make a grant under certain authority of the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act for any state that received an allocation in a prior fiscal year, but is not otherwise eligible for an FY2015 allocation because the areas in the state outside of qualifying metropolitan statistical areas in FY2015 (modified to reflect revised delineations established by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] and Executive Order No. 10253) do not have the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) otherwise required.

(Sec. 227) Prohibits during any PHA FY2015 the use of funds, made available for specified purposes of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (including the section 8 tenant-based rental assistance program), by any PHA for any amount of salary, including bonuses, for its chief executive officer, or any other official or employee that exceeds the annual rate of basic pay for a position at level IV of the Executive Schedule.

Repeals the requirement that the rental value of the unit be determined by the PHA. Authorizes the Secretary, in the alternative, to establish another applicable fair market rental that more accurately reflects local market conditions, based on a market area geographically smaller than the one otherwise used for such purposes. Permits a PHA to apply to the Secretary for exception allowing for a flat rental amount for a property lower than the amount otherwise determined under the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to grant such an exception if: (1) the fair market rental determined pursuant to either the primary or alternative calculation does not reflect the property\\'s actual market value, and (2) the proposed lower flat rental amount is based on a market analysis of the applicable market and complies with the further requirement that rent structures not create a disincentive for continued residency in public housing by families who are attempting to become economically self-sufficient through employment or who have attained a level of self-sufficiency through their own efforts. Repeals the June 1, 2014, deadline for PHA compliance with the requirement to establish a flat rental amount for a PHA dwelling unit at such levels.

Division O: Multiemployer Pension Reform - Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 - Title I: Modifications to Multiemployer Plan Rules - Subtitle A: Amendments to Pension Protection Act of 2006 - (Sec. 101) Amends the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to repeal the December 31, 2014, sunset of, and make permanent, the PPA multiemployer funding rules. (Sec. 102) Amends ERISA and the IRC to authorize the sponsor of a multiemployer plan that is not in critical status for a plan year, but that is projected by the plan actuary to be in critical status in any of the succeeding five plan years, to elect to be in critical status effective for the current plan year. Prescribes annual certification and notice requirements. (Sec. 103) Revises requirements for the emergence of a plan from critical status to add a requirement that the plan actuary certify that the plan is not projected to become insolvent for any of the 30 succeeding plan years. Requires an emerged plan to reenter critical status only if it meets either of the current or the new criterion for critical status. (Sec. 104) Declares that a plan shall cease to be in endangered status for a plan year if:  the plan actuary certifies that it is projected to no longer to qualify for such status at the end of the 10th plan year after it entered that status, and the plan was not in critical or endangered status for the immediately preceding plan year.  (Sec. 105) Revises the formula for determining an increase in a plan\\'s funding percentage, which is one of the two goals of a funding improvement plan that must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status. (Sec. 106) Revises rules for operation of a plan in endangered status during the period of adoption of a funding improvement plan. (Sec. 107) Revises requirements for the imposition of a schedule for multiemployer plans in endangered or critical status where, after a collective bargaining agreement expires, the bargaining parties fail to adopt a contribution schedule under a funding improvement plan (endangered status) or a rehabilitation plan (critical status). (Sec. 108) Repeals rules for the reorganization of multiemployer plans, including related minimum contribution requirements, the overburden credit against minimum contribution requirements, and requirements for adjustments in accrued benefits. Treats remaining references to plans in reorganization as plans in critical status. (Sec. 109) Revises requirements for rehabilitation plans that must be adopted for multiemployer plans in critical status. Revises in particular the requirements, when determining an employer\\'s withdrawal liability, for the disregard of:  benefit reductions in determining a plan\\'s unfunded vested benefits, and surcharges in determining the allocation of such unfunded vested benefits.   Requires the disregard of surcharges, as well, in determining the highest contribution rate. Requires disregard also, in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer, and in determining the highest contribution rate, of any increase in the contribution rate (or any other increase in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided) that is required or made in order to enable the multiemployer plan to meet the requirements of the funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan. Declares that, in the case of such disregarded increases in the contribution rate (or other increases in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided), these requirements shall cease to apply once a collective bargaining agreement expires which was in effect when the multiemployer plan emerged from endangered or critical status. (Sec. 110) Declares that a qualified preretirement survivor annuity payable to the surviving spouse of a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became insolvent or was terminated. (Thus guarantees, in the absence of other disqualifying factors, the payment by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity to a participant of a multiemployer pension plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated.) Makes this prohibition retroactive to multiemployer plan benefit payments payable on or after January 1, 1985, except where the surviving spouse has died before enactment of this Act. (Sec. 111) Expands the sorts of information the administrator of a multiemployer define benefit plan must furnish, upon request, to any plan participant or beneficiary, employee representative, or employer obliged to contribute to the plan. Adds to the list, among other things, copies of the current plan document, the latest summary plan description, the current trust agreement, an employer\\'s participation agreement, audited plan financial statements, and the latest funding improvement or rehabilitation plan and related contribution schedules for any plan in critical or endangered status. Authorizes any employee representative, or any employer obliged to contribute to a plan, to bring a civil action to: (1) enjoin any act or practice which violates these disclosure requirements, or (2) obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress a violation or enforce the requirements. Subtitle B: Multiemployer Plan Mergers and Partitions - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the PBGC, upon sponsor request, to take appropriate action to promote and facilitate the merger of two or more multiemployer plans if it determines that the transaction is in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of at least one of the plans and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans. Permits such facilitation to include training, technical assistance, mediation, communication with stakeholders, and support with related requests to other government agencies.  Authorizes the PBGC to enable one or more of the plans involved in a merger to avoid or postpone insolvency by providing financial assistance to a merged plan, but only if:  one or more of the multiemployer plans participating in the merger is in critical and declining status; the PBGC reasonably expects that the financial assistance will reduce its expected long-term loss with respect to the plans involved, and is necessary for the merged plan to become or remain solvent; and  the financial assistance is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans.  (Sec. 122) Revises requirements for the partition of a plan. Makes a multiemployer plan eligible for partition only if:  the plan is in critical and declining status; the PBGC determines, after consultation with the selected Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate, that the plan sponsor has taken (or is taking concurrently with an application for partition) all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, including certain maximum benefit suspensions, if applicable; the PBGC reasonably expects that a partition will reduce it\\'s expected long-term loss with respect to the plan, and is necessary for the plan to remain solvent; the PBGC certifies to Congress that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other plans (including any liabilities associated with multiemployer plans that are insolvent or that are projected to become insolvent within 10 years) will not be impaired by the partition; and the cost to the PBGC arising from the partition is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans.  Requires a partition order to provide for a transfer to a successor plan of the minimum amount of the partitioned plan\\'s liabilities necessary for the plan to remain solvent. Prescribes requirements for:  the withdrawal liability of any employer that withdraws from the partitioned plan within 10 years after the partition order, and  payment of the monthly benefit to each participant or beneficiary of the partitioned plan whose benefit was transferred to the successor plan.  Requires any successor plan that provides a benefit improvement effective after the partition\\'s effective date to pay the PBGC a specified amount related to the increase in benefit payments for each year during the 10-year period following partition. Requires the partitioned plan to pay the premiums imposed by the PBGC with respect to participants whose benefits were transferred to the successor plan for each year during that 10-year period. Subtitle C: Strengthening the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation - (Sec. 131) Increases the annual premium rate payable to the PBGC by a multiemployer plan for basic benefits guaranteed to $26 for each individual participant in the plan during each plan year beginning after December 31, 2014. Prescribes a formula for this rate for each plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2015. Requires that specified amounts of premiums received with respect to the fund used for basic multiemployer plan guaranteed benefits be placed in a noninterest-bearing account within the fund. Requires that any PBGC financial assistance to prevent a plan from becoming insolvent be withdrawn proportionately from the noninterest-bearing and other accounts within the fund. Title II: Remediation Measures for Deeply Troubled Plans - (Sec. 201) Revises conditions, limitations, distribution and notice requirements, and the approval process for benefit suspensions under multiemployer plans in critical and declining status. Allows a plan sponsor, by plan amendment, to suspend benefits temporarily or permanently, in accordance with certain requirements, if a plan is in declining as well as critical status, if it is projected to become insolvent during the current plan year or any of the 14 succeeding plan years (19 succeeding plan years if the plan has a ratio of inactive participants to active participants that exceeds 2 to 1, or if the funded percentage of the plan is less than 80%). Requires any suspension of benefits to remain in effect until the earlier of when the plan sponsor provides benefit improvements or the suspension expires by its own terms. Declares that the plan shall not be liable for any benefit payments not made as a result of a suspension of benefits. Requires the sponsor of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, not later than 60 days before applying to suspend benefits, to select a plan participant in pay status to act as a retiree representative to advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and plan beneficiaries throughout the suspension approval process. Prescribes as conditions for suspending benefits that:  the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency, assuming the suspensions of benefits continue until they expire by their own terms or, if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely; and the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension).  Specifies limitations on any suspension of benefits, including that:  the monthly benefit of any participant or beneficiary may not be reduced below 110% of the monthly benefit guaranteed by the PBGC on the date of the suspension; not more of the benefits of a participant or beneficiary age 75 years as of the suspension date may be suspended than a certain applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefits that would otherwise be suspended, computed according to a specified formula; no benefits based on disability may be suspended; any suspensions of benefits, in the aggregate, shall be reasonably estimated to achieve, but not materially exceed, the level necessary to avoid insolvency; any benefit suspensions shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking specified factors into account; and  the benefits suspended shall be applied according to three specified priorities.  Allows a plan sponsor, in its sole discretion, to provide benefit improvements while any suspension of benefits remains in effect. Prohibits the sponsor, however, from increasing plan liabilities by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless certain conditions are met, including an equitable distribution of such improvements. Prescribes requirements for: (1) notice to participants and beneficiaries, (2) the process for approval of a suspension application by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, and (3) a participant ratification voting process. Permits a suspension of benefits to be implemented, notwithstanding rejection of suspension by a participant ratification vote, if the plan is systemically important (i.e., the present value of its PBGC-projected financial assistance payments exceeds $1 billion if suspensions are not implemented). Subjects to judicial review any plan sponsor action to challenge denial of an application for suspension of benefits. Division P: Other Retirement-Related Modifications - (Sec. 1) Amends ERISA with respect to the treatment as a substantial employer subject to specified liability of any employer that ceases operations at a facility in any location with the result that more than 20% percent of the total number of the employees participating under the employer\\'s single-employer pension plan are separated from employment. (The substantial employer liability referred to as specified under current law is the liability of a substantial employer for withdrawal from, or termination of, single-employer plans under multiple controlled groups.) Revises the meaning of a substantial cessation of operations. Eliminates the requirement that more than 20% of the total number of the employer\\'s employees who participate under its single-employer plan be separated from employment. Exempts from the general rule any single employer plan if, for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the substantial cessation of operations occurred: (1) there were fewer than 100 participants with accrued benefits under the plan as of its valuation date, or (2) the ratio of the market value of the assets of the plan to the plan\\'s funding target for the plan year was 90% or greater. Redefines \"substantial cessation of operations\" as a permanent cessation of operations at a facility which results in a workforce reduction of a number of eligible employees at the facility equivalent to more than 15% of the number of all the employer\\'s eligible employees, determined immediately before the earlier of: (1) the date of the employer\\'s decision to implement the cessation; or (2) the earliest date on which any such eligible employee was separated from employment in the case of a workforce reduction including one or more eligible employees whose separation, during the three years before the cessation, is nonetheless related to permanent cessation of operations at the facility. Precludes from taking into account in computing a workforce reduction any separated employee replaced, within a reasonable period of time, at the same or another facility located in the United States, by a U.S. citizen or resident. Prescribes criteria for disregarding in the computation of a workforce reduction either an eligible employee separated from employment with the transferor employer at a facility or an eligible employee who continues to be employed at the facility by the transferee employer. Prescribes requirements for treatment of eligible separated employees when a portion of operations, otherwise substantially ceased, are subsequently conducted by another (transferee) employer by reason of a sale or other disposition of the assets or stock of a contributing sponsor (or any member of the same controlled group as the sponsor) of the plan. Permits an employer to satisfy its liability with respect to a plan by reason of the treatment accorded under this Act in the event of a substantial cessation of operations at a facility by making contributions to the plan, in addition to any minimum required contribution, and in amount determined according to a specified formula, for each plan year in the seven-plan-year period beginning when the cessation occurred.  Waives an employer\\'s obligation to make such additional contributions, however, with respect to: (1) the first plan year (after the cessation occurs) for which the ratio of the market value of the plan assets to the plan\\'s funding target for the plan year is 90% or greater, or (2) any plan year following such a year. Makes such a waiver permanent if the Secretary of the Treasury issues the funding waiver for a plan year within the seven-plan-year period beginning when the cessation occurred. Prescribes requirements for enforcement of any additional plan contributions elected.  Declares that, for purposes of this Act, an employer shall not be treated as ceasing operations at a qualified lodging facility (hotel, motel, or any other establishment more than half of whose dwelling units are used on a transient basis) if those operations are continued by an eligible independent contractor pursuant to an agreement with the employer. (Sec. 2) Formulates a special rule for determining normal retirement age for certain existing defined benefit plans. Exempts from the established normal retirement age requirement any defined benefit plan whose terms, on or before December 8, 2014, provided for a normal retirement age which is the earlier of:  an age otherwise permitted by the established normal retirement age requirement, or the age at which a participant completes the number of years (at least 30 years) of benefit accrual service specified by the plan.  States that a plan shall not fail to be treated as an applicable plan solely because this alternative normal retirement age only applied to certain participants or only applied to employees of certain employers in the case of a multiemployer plan. Allows such a plan to expand the application of its alternative normal retirement age to additional participants or to employees of additional employers maintaining the plan, as long as they: (1) became participants on or before January 1, 2017; or (2) were employees before this date of any employer maintaining the plan, and who become plan participants after January 1, 2017. (Sec. 3) Amends both ERISA and the IRC to apply the rules for cooperative and small employer charity pension plans to a defined benefit employee pension plan (other than a multiemployer plan) maintained, as of June 25, 2010, by a tax-exempt charitable organization:  with employees in at least 40 states, and  whose primary exempt purpose is to provide services with respect to children.  Division Q: Budgetary Effects - (Sec. 1) Exempts the budgetary effects of division 0 (Multiemployer Pension Reform) and division P (Other Retirement- Related Modifications) from provisions of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 and the FY2008 Senate Budget Resolution requiring offsets for legislation increasing the budget deficit. Provides that the budget effects of the two divisions shall not be estimated for the purposes of enforcing discretionary spending limits or specified provisions of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.

Includes within the scope of a claim in bankruptcy certain equity securities held in a defined contribution plan for the benefit of certain individuals, but only if an employer or plan sponsor who has commenced a case in bankruptcy has committed fraud regarding the plan or has otherwise breached a duty to the participant that has proximately caused the loss of value. Allows as an administrative expense of the estate: (1) severance pay owed to certain employees of the debtor for layoff or termination (which pay shall be deemed earned in full), and (2) damages as a result of violation of law by the debtor.  Includes among prerequisites for confirmation of a business reorganization bankruptcy plan (Chapter 11) provision for: (1) recovery of damages payable for the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, or other financial returns as negotiated by the debtor and the authorized representative; (2) continued payment of retiree benefits maintained or established by the debtor before the petition filing date if no modifications are made before confirmation of the plan; and (3) recovery of claims arising from the modification of retiree benefits or for certain financial returns, as negotiated by the debtor and the authorized representative. Revises requirements governing: (1) rejection of collective bargaining agreements; (2) payment of insurance benefits to retired employees, including benefit modifications proposed by the trustee; and (3) a trustee's administrative power to dispose of property. Requires the court, in approving a sale of business assets, to consider the extent to which a bidder has offered to maintain existing jobs, preserve terms and conditions of employment, and assume or match pension and retiree health benefit obligations in determining whether an offer constitutes the highest or best offer for such property. Requires the bankruptcy court to allow certain claims asserted by an active or retired participant, or by a labor organization representing such participant, for any shortfall in pension benefits accrued as a result of the termination of the plan and limitations upon the payment of certain statutory benefits. States that, if employees have not received wages and benefits for services rendered on and after the date of the commencement of the case in bankruptcy, such unpaid obligations shall be deemed necessary costs and expenses of preserving, or disposing of, property securing an allowed secured claim and shall be recovered even if the trustee has otherwise waived certain provisions under an agreement with the holder of the allowed secured claim. Allows reduction of a debtor's time frame for filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan in the event of: (1) the filing of a motion seeking rejection of a collective bargaining agreement if a plan based upon an alternative proposal by the labor organization is reasonably likely to be confirmed within a reasonable time; or (2) the proposed filing of a plan by a proponent other than the debtor, which incorporates the terms of a settlement with a labor organization, if such plan is reasonably likely to be confirmed within a reasonable time. Modifies requirements for confirmation of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan to prohibit approval of: (1) payments or other distributions for the benefit of insiders, senior executive officers, and certain highly compensated employees or consultants providing services to the debtor, except as part of those generally applicable to the debtor's employees if the court determines that such payments are not excessive or disproportionate compared to distributions to the debtor's nonmanagement workforce; and (2) insider compensation unless approved by the court as reasonable according to specified criteria. Restricts: (1) certain executive compensation enhancements as part of the allowance of administrative expenses; (2) trustee assumption of certain deferred compensation arrangements for the benefit of insiders, senior executive officers, or certain highly compensated employees of the debtor; and (3) trustee assumption of retiree benefits for insiders, senior executive officers, or certain highly compensated employees of the debtor if the debtor has obtained relief to impose reductions in retiree benefits, or health benefits of active employees of the debtor, or has reduced or eliminated health benefits for active or retired employees within 180 days before the date of the commencement of the case.  Requires the court, where a debtor has obtained relief by which it reduces the cost of its obligations under a collective bargaining agreement or a retiree plan, fund, or program of retiree benefits, to determine before granting relief the percentage diminution in the value of the obligations when compared to the debtor's obligations under the collective bargaining agreement, or with respect to retiree benefits. Authorizes the trustee in bankruptcy to avoid a transfer made in anticipation of bankruptcy to or for the benefit of an insider, including certain consultants who were formerly insiders and who are retained to provide services to an entity that becomes a debtor. Grants a labor organization creditor status for purposes of filing a proof of claim.

Applies the credit counseling requirement to a Chapter 13 debtor who certifies receipt of notice that the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence may commence a foreclosure on it. Requires the court to disallow a claim that is subject to any remedy for rescission under the Truth in Lending Act, notwithstanding the prior entry of a foreclosure judgment. Permits a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to modify the rights of claim holders with respect to a claim for a loan originated before the effective date of this Act and secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence that is the subject of a foreclosure notice. Authorizes reduction of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence, but only in specified circumstances, particularly if the debtor sells the residence. Permits a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to deny debtor liability for certain fees and charges incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending and arising from a debt secured by the debtor's principal residence, unless the claim holder observes specified requirements. Adds to conditions for court confirmation of a plan in bankruptcy that: (1) the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence retain the lien securing the claim until the later of the payment of the claim as reduced and modified, completion of all payments under the plan, or the discharge of a debtor from all debts; and (2) the plan modifies the claim in good faith and the court does not find that the debtor has been convicted of obtaining by actual fraud the extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit that gives rise to a modified claim. Authorizes the court, upon request, to confirm a plan proposing a reduction in the interest rate on the loan secured by such security interest and that does not reduce the principal, if certain requirements are met.

Directs the Secretary to require each mortgagee, as a condition for approval to originate or underwrite mortgages on HUD-insured single family or multifamily housing, to notify the Secretary of the action taken, and the reasons for it, if the mortgagee: (1) engages in the purchase of mortgages insured by the Secretary and originated by other mortgagees, or in the purchase of the servicing rights to such mortgages; and (2) at any time takes action to terminate or discontinue such purchases from another mortgagee based on any determination or evidence of fraud or material misrepresentation in connection with the origination of such mortgages.
